    "IF Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest decision-making statement is the \"if\" statement. It is used to determine if a statement or a block of statements will be executed or not, i.e., if a condition is true, a block of statements will be performed; otherwise, it will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "After examination, the condition will be either true or false. The \"if\" statement takes boolean values; if the value is true, the block of statements below it will be executed; otherwise, it will not. We may also use a condition using the bracket '(' ')'.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, the body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. The body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python interprets non-zero values as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.\n",
